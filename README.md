Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application allows you to visually understand how different sorting algorithms work, including Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.  

Introduction  
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and this visualizer aims to make them more accessible by providing a graphical representation of how different algorithms sort an array of elements.  

Features  
Visual representation of sorting algorithms  
Adjustable array size  
Adjustable sorting speed  
Step-by-step visualization  

Usage  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.  
3. Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.  
4. Adjust the array size using the slider.  
5. Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array.  
6. Click the "Sort" button to visualize the chosen sorting algorithm.
